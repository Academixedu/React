### Step 1: Install Node.js

1. **Download Node.js**:
   - Visit the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
   - Download the LTS (Long-Term Support) version, which is recommended for most users.

2. **Install Node.js**:
   - Run the installer and follow the instructions.
   - Make sure to check the box that says "Automatically install necessary tools" if it appears during installation.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal on Mac).
   - Run the following commands to check that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) were installed correctly:
     ```sh
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

### Step 2: Create a New React Application

1. **Install Create React App**:
   - In your terminal, run the following command to install Create React App globally:
     ```sh
     npm install -g create-react-app
     ```

2. **Create Your React App**:
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new React application.
   - Run the following command, replacing `my-app` with your desired project name:
     ```sh
     npx create-react-app my-app
     ```

3. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   - Change directory to your new React application folder:
     ```sh
     cd my-app
     ```

### Step 3: Run Your React Application

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   - In your project directory, run the following command to start the development server:
     ```sh
     npm start
     ```

2. **Open Your React App in a Browser**:
   - After running `npm start`, your default web browser should automatically open and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
   - If it doesnâ€™t open automatically, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

You should see a page with the React logo and some boilerplate text, indicating that your React application is running successfully!

### Step 4: Modify Your React Application

1. **Open Your Project in a Code Editor**:
   - Open the `my-app` directory in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

2. **Edit the Source Files**:
   - The main source files are located in the `src` folder.
   - Modify `src/App.js` to start customizing your React application.

3. **Save Changes and View Updates**:
   - Save your changes and go back to your browser. The development server should automatically reload the app with your updates.
